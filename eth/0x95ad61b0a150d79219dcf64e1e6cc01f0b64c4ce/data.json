Shiba Inu was created in August 2020 by an individual or group called Ryoshi and is considered as a meme coin, which are cryptocurrencies associated with some theme, but often launched as a joke. On Oct. 29, 2021, Shiba Inu's price peaked more than tenfold, giving it a market capitalization of $41 billion.The Shiba Inu EcosystemThe guiding principles of Shiba Inu are outlined in a \"woof paper\" available on ShibaToken.com. The ecosystem was developed as an experiment in decentralized spontaneous community building, with a community of over 500,000 members who embrace its founding principles. Shiba Inu is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token, hosted on the Ethereum blockchain for decentralization purposes. The ecosystem consists of three tokens: Shiba Inu (SHIB), Leash (LEASH), and Bone (BONE). It also includes ShibaSwap, the Shiba Inu Incubator, and Shiboshis.Canine Terminology in SHIB's EcosystemIn line with its dog theme, the \"woof paper\" uses canine terms to describe how returns can be generated from Shiba Inu tokens.
