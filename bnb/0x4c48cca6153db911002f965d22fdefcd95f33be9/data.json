  "description": "The Essential Coin (ESC) A community-driven token with an evolving reflection system that has a focus on continuous, sustainable and steady growth. Our main objective is to offer as much value and utility to our community members as possible. Our initial goal at launch is to provide passive and continuous income to our holders, but that’s only the first step towards the future. We aim to build a true ecosystem with many exciting features planned in a phased manner. Our roadmap includes a governance system that will enable you to have a say in the project’s decisions, a staking platform, farming tools to earn more income, an NFT Marketplace where you can mint, trade and showcase your NFTs, and a swap platform, all of which will be centrally connected to the ESC token. We also plan to have a set of unique physical NFTs which our members can buy and trade on our platform. We aim to put our tokens to real life use to keep generating new revenue streams for the holders!",
