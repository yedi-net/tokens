  "description": "Volt Inu ($VOLT) is a hyper-deflationary token whose aim is to invest in multiple asset classes such as NFTs, nodes, altcoins, staking &amp; farming of stable coins. This investment diversity allows mitigating the risk while taking advantage of the possible non-correlated growth of the trending assets. Since $VOLT is intended to be a hyper-deflationary token, profits made on treasury investments are then used to buy back &amp; burn $VOLT tokens. In addition to this deflationary mechanism, $VOLT has implemented an automatic 4% burn tax on BSC. The merger of these two mechanisms guarantees a continuously rising price floor due to the decrease in the circulating supply.",
