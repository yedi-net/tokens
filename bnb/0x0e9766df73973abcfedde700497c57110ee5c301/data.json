  "description": "Launched on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) in May 2021, $HODL has already rewarded its holders with over 20,000 BNB. The token employs innovative transaction taxes to generate earnings for investors who hold their tokens. Each buy, sell, and transfer incurs a 5% tax, divided into 4% going to a reward pool for investors and 1% as reflections of $HODL to investors. This structure allows holders to earn passive income as the taxed tokens are converted into BNB and placed in a reward pool accessible every 7 days.",
