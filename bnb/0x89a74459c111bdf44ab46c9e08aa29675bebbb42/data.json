  "description": "The OGSafemoon token was created for one purpose which is to bring ownership back to the community and create an opportunity for life changing financial freedom. Our founders wanted a SafemoonV1 style contract without the need for devs, team fees, etc. We believe in a OGSafemoon contract that is truly renounced and decentralized. That’s what we are all about and want DeFi to remain. We look up to tokens like Shiba Inu because they have shown what the power of strong community can build! That’s all OGSafemoon is, power of community. Here at OGSafemoon I am dev, you are dev we are all dev!",
